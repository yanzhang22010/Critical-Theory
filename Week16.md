In contemporary society, with the development of technology and culture, the definition of an artist has undergone significant changes. Generally speaking, posthuman artists refer to those who use advanced scientific technologies to create art. Victoria Modesta, as a singer, creative director, and television presenter, performs with a unique music style and visual effects in her works.

Victoria Modesta employs powerful visual effects and advanced technological means to deliver impressive artistic performances. For instance, as evidenced in the images, she uses prosthetic limbs with internal LED lights, pearl-encrusted prosthetic limbs, and black pointed prosthetic limbs in her music videos, all of which are highly characteristic.

On the other hand, transhumanist artists are those with extraordinary talents who possess strong personal abilities to create expressive and impactful works of art. Victoria Modesta's performance and music style are both highly individualistic, and she challenges stereotypical female images through her powerful performances. This aspect is consistent with the philosophy of transhumanist art.

Victoria Modesta not only employs advanced technological means for her performances but also fully demonstrates her artistic talent to create impressive artistic works. Her art contains elements of both transhumanist and posthumanist philosophies, and these elements can mutually integrate with each other.
