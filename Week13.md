## This time we saw two exhibitions, I think the content of the two stations is very different.

## Designer-Maker-User

From the point of view of the designer, the maker, and the user, and the relationship between the three, the exhibition features almost 1,000,20th and 21st-century designs, it covers everything from the Industrial Revolution to the digital age. For over 100 years, food, clothing, housing, and transportation have been very epoch-making and landmark items. In this exhibition, the audience can see the same object from the original version to the present.
Personally, I don't think Designer-Maker-User's exhibition is very much like an art exhibition, like a textbook popularization of design knowledge. Inside the museum, you can see how many products you can see everywhere in your life are designed, the creation process of the designer, the evolution of the design products, the design specifications of the typeface and logo, and so on are also clearly shown.

My favorite part of the exhibition is the wall at the entrance, which has signposts, subway maps, and decorated walls of various living things, from the 25th country, showing our relationship with everyday things. Every object on the wall has a special meaning when it is created. Through this exhibition, I can see how designers are changing their design concepts with the development of technology. During the exhibition, we will also think about the relationship between the beauty of Design, practicability, and commercial value. Showing me what is a good design? What are the elements of good design?
There are also many obvious drawbacks to the exhibition, which is very low in audience engagement and playability. It doesn't feel like an art exhibition, it feels like a History Museum of popular science. If we can add some interactive parts, it will improve the mood of the audience.

## Objects of desire

The second is an exhibition of surrealism Objects of desire

 >Surrealism is not a style-but a state of mind It aims To subvert reality. To find the uncanny in the everyday. To tap into our unconscious desires And bring dreams To life. And for many artists around the world, It has been a way To challenge authority And imagine a new world.

The exhibition at the Museum of design differs from previous surrealism exhibitions in that it focuses more on the surreal aspects of design, such as furniture, interiors, fashion, etc. , the sugar cube and the ring holder are a ring, a curving brush that might also be used as a coat hanger, a chair that grows out of its arms and cries out, a sofa that turns into a giant red lip, and the entire exhibition space filled with grotesque imagination, it's amazing the possibilities of the surreal.

The exhibition's narrative is largely chronological, starting with the 1940s and continuing to the present day, showing how surrealism has influenced the field of design. In addition to the design works, there are also many works of art, such as painting, photography, video, etc. . There are also some photo materials about surreal artists. The whole exhibition is very rich in content. There are many, many works by surreal masters, such as Salvador Dali's works from beginning to end, furniture design, painting works and clothing co-titles in almost every section. What impressed me was the lobster telephone, the lobster's reproductive organ in the tail, and the author connected it to the mouth of the telephone where it spoke, symbolizing the union of Surrealism and life. Salvador Dali is an artist with an extraordinary imagination. His works are often related to dreams and consciousness. In those seemingly broken images, he skillfully constructs an art world of his own.

Apart from the fact that the work itself is very interesting, the attention to detail of the curatorial team is also very good. Just the right amount of dim light, the lampposts in the velvet bag, and the fluttering of the tabs all add to the completeness and sophistication of the exhibition.

But compared with the classics, modern surrealism does not fit the theme of the exhibition well, as if it is merely a demonstration of new technology and lacks the creativity to be a classic. There are so many works in the exhibition that the space of the exhibition is very dense, even a little crowded. There is nothing between each work that makes it impossible to immerse oneself in the work. The end of the exhibition is very sudden, with a row of books and many exhibitions around the exit, very abrupt, destroying the dream of the exhibition atmosphere.
