## 1 Before doing any text reading:

In ordinary language learning, reading and writing skills refer to the four aspects of listening, speaking, reading, and writing, which test individuals' understanding and expression abilities in language. In particular, individuals communicate, understand, and express information through reading and writing. Reading and writing skills are one of the fundamental communication skills for humans and are essential for personal learning, work, socialization, and life.

With the development of time and technology, reading and writing methods are gradually changing. In the past, most people's reading and writing were done on paper. People used to read and write on paper books. However, with the development of digital technology and the popularity of computers, the way of reading and writing is undergoing tremendous changes. Most people's reading and writing are now done online, involving electronic reading or digital writing. For example, in the past, writers needed to send their manuscripts to publishing houses by mail, and after being screened, they would be published in physical newspapers or magazines. Now, writers can upload their works directly to websites for readers to read. Most newspapers and magazines have welcomed industry reforms and joined the new media industry. Therefore, for the general public, reading and writing skills not only represent traditional reading and writing but also represent the ability to collect, evaluate, and select information.

In my understanding, computers are also referred to as reading and writing skills because computers have their language and text. The programming we learn is using computer text to solve problems and realize our creativity, similar to how people communicate and communicate through language or text. Programming is essential to modern society, and regardless of the discipline, learning programming skills is being encouraged. According to previous news reports, most primary schools in first-tier cities in China have launched basic programming courses. Programming skills are no longer limited to the skills possessed by programmers alone. Even in physics and mathematics and other university majors, schools also offer programming courses, hoping that students can use programming knowledge to help their own professional learning and research.

## 2 After reading the assigned text:

The book "Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming is Changing Writing," co-authored by Vee and Annette, explores the relationship between computer programming and writing. The authors argue that coding has become a crucial cultural literacy and a new form of literacy in contemporary society. They contend that writing and coding share many similarities and that we can build other activities and knowledge on the foundation of coding, just as we do with human language when reading and writing.

While programming is often viewed as specialized knowledge within the field of computer science, Vee and Annette argue that writing was once a similarly exclusive skill that required a high level of proficiency. However, with the widespread availability of education, writing has become a basic skill, just as coding has become more accessible with the proliferation of computing devices and the internet. The use of computers has also become more diverse, ranging from professional business applications to literary analysis, creative projects, and even creative coding as a means of engaging in social activities.In "Live Coding: A User's Manual," the authors introduce live coding and analyze practical examples. Apart from cultural and technical issues related to live coding, the book provides new perspectives and ideas for exploring digital art and culture.

Sam Aaron, a live coding advocate, has been promoting coding as a creative tool in various industries and emphasizing its importance. Michael Mateas argues that coding literacy is a basic skill that everyone needs to participate fully in contemporary society. Mark Guzdial suggests that programming is an important component of computational literacy, just as people learn arithmetic using numbers and poetry using written language, they can also learn computing through programming. According to Vee and Annette, coding literacy reshapes not only computer programming but also our reading and writing abilities. As a comprehensive concept, coding literacy includes not only technical abilities but also programmatic thinking, teamwork, and other related skills. More and more artists, scientists, and engineers are participating in the development of a new interdisciplinary form of computational literacy.
